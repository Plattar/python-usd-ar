_Python USD AR_ is a docker container that contains pre-built versions of [Pixar USD](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD) toolchain and [Apple USDZ Schema](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/usdz_schemas_for_ar) definitions. Due to the amount of time it takes to build these tools, this container can serve as a useful base for other applications. Check out the Plattar [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/plattar/python-usd-ar) repository for the latest pre-built images.

Looking for the standard _Python USD_ images without Apple USDZ Schema Definitions? Check out the [python-usd](https://github.com/Plattar/python-usd) repository.
